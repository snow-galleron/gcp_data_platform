**Before running:**

1. **Create Secrets:** In Google Cloud Secret Manager, create secrets for:  `dataset_id`, `table_list` (comma-separated list), `db_user`, `db_password`, `db_name`, `db_host`, `db_port`, `staging_bucket`, `temp_bucket`.  Ensure the service account running the Dataflow job has access to these secrets.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have the necessary packages installed: `apache-beam`, `psycopg2-binary`, `google-cloud-secret-manager`.

3. **Permissions:** Verify that your service account has the necessary permissions to access Secret Manager, BigQuery, and PostgreSQL.

4. **JDBC Driver:** The PostgreSQL JDBC driver (`postgresql-42.6.jar` or later) needs to be accessible to your Dataflow workers. You might need to stage it in your GCS staging location.  Beam's `ReadFromJdbc` doesn't automatically handle this.  Consider using a more robust solution like a custom transform to handle the JDBC driver.
